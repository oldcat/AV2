While our tests show that an approach of hard thresholding to find the black quadrelateral in these images it is likely that with a different video we would have to completely re calibrate our thresholds. This is something we would not have to do with the flat part finding algorithm so while it was less successful in these tests it is likely that even our code would be more successful on unseen data. 

It is likely that hard thresholding will always be a quicker method of achieving results as the flat part finding algorithm has to search the image for the flat section and then perform multiple RanSaC runs on it to check it is a plane. it is also likely that with further refining of the parameters around our flat part finding algorithm that this method would have been more successful.
